# Repository Rules

This repository uses a single source of truth for its rules and workflows, located in the `.agents/workflows/` directory.

Before writing code, creating folders, proposing commits, or modifying the README, you MUST read and strictly follow the markdown files located in `.agents/workflows/`.

Specifically:
- You must follow `.agents/workflows/new-project.md` when asked to create or start a new project, example, or topic.
- You must follow `.agents/workflows/commit-rules.md` when formatting commit messages.
